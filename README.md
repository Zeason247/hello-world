# hello-world
Just getting started
A PhD student of seismic data processing that knows just little about programing
It's been challenging but here I am to explore all I can especially to learn for great men and women who have gone ahead
Now I need to learn how to train a data, determine my dictionary, D and sparsity coefficient.
